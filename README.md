# host-galaxies-stats

This project provides tools for investigating the host-galaxy population of astrophysical transients.
The paper describing this project can be found here [The Host Galaxies of Fast Radio Bursts Track a Combination of Stellar Mass and Star Formation, Similar to Type Ia Supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08038)

This framework uses a galaxy distribution trained with Prospector code (J. Leja et al. 2017; B. D. Johnson et al. 2021), hence it is limited to galaxies that have modeled with this code. The choice of other SED-modeling code might systematically affect the inferred galaxy properties (J. Leja et al. 2019, 2022).
